Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA),"The process of analysing datasets to summarise their main characteristics, often using visual methods, before formal modeling.",
Functional programming,A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.,
[Git](https://git-scm.com/),A distributed version control system used to track changes in source code during software development.,
[GitHub](https://github.com/),A cloud-based platform that provides hosting for repositories of files and folders (usually of software code) using git as its backend for version control.,

TOML,"Tom's Obvious Minimal Language - simple, human-readable data serialisation format designed for configuration files, emphasizing readability and ease of use. Used by `uv` to specify its projects.",
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv),"A Python package manager, which can manage python projects (folders) and manage the installation and management of the python environment and libraries within that folder.",
