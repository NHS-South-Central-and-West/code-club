Code Club aims to support everyone at SCW in developing technical and analytical skills through ~~interpretive dance~~ code. We believe these skills are indispensable to the NHS today and in the future, enabling the delivery of high-quality insights through data science and advanced analytics, and the automation of day-to-day tasks with programming. We want to foster an environment that welcomes everybody, sparks ideas, and nurtures collaboration.

The Code Club syllabus has been designed to help people with little to no coding experience develop their skills in Python and extend their analytical skills through code. Sessions will be an hour long and held once per fortnight at 2:00 PM on Thursdays. Code Club has come a long way since the reboot in May 2025 and we are now offering tutorials on [Intermediate Skills](/intermediate-skills-sessions/intermediate_skills_schedule.html), in line with the National Competency Framework (plus a few things we think you will find useful and enjoyable!). If you are just joining us and are new to Python (or you just want to go back and refresh your memory), you can find materials to get you started plus some coding and data science essentials on our [Essential Skills](/sessions/schedule.html) page.
