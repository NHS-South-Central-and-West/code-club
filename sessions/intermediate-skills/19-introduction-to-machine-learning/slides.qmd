# A Familiar Problem {data-background-color="#425563"}

Predicting the Future Using Only the Past

## The Challenge of Prediction {.center}

- Prediction is a fundamental part of data science and analytics.
- Using what happened in the past can help inform us about the future.
- But data, on its own, can only tell us about the past.

## The NHS Dashboard Obsession {.center}

- In the NHS, we often rely on dashboards describing the past to inform decisions about the future.
- This is inherently limited.
    - Many factors cause the future to differ from the past
    - Decision-making relies heavily on human judgment
    - Difficult to scale across thousands of cases
- **We need better approaches to prediction**

## Traditional Approaches {.center}

- **Rules-based systems** - Predictions based on explicit rules (IF condition THEN action).
    - If diabetes AND age > 65 AND previous admission, flag as high risk
    - Works well when rules are known and context is simple, but struggles with complexity and scale.
- **Statistical methods** - Traditional statistical methods like regression.
    - Model readmission probability based on patient characteristics.
    - We need something that can be automated and applied at scale.

Blending Statistics & Software Development

## What is Machine Learning? {.center}

- Machine learning builds systems that learn patterns from data to make predictions about the future.
- It blends statistical methods and software development principles to solve problems of complexity and scale.
- It can produce highly effective predictions, applicable at scale, and deployable in the real world.

## Why Use Machine Learning {.center}

- Handles complexity 
    - Many variables, non-linear relationships
    - Finds interactions you wouldn't think to test
- Scales effectively
    - Same approach works with 10 or 10,000 features
    - Predictions can be automated and applied widely
- Improves with data
    - More examples = better performance
    - Adapts to changing patterns

## What Machine Learning Is Not {.center}

- **ML is not magic** - It still requires good data and domain knowledge.
- **ML is not always better** - Sometimes traditional approaches work fine.
- **ML is not (necessarily) a black box** - Many models are interpretable, and we can understand why they make their predictions.
- **ML not replacing analysts** - It's a tool that extends what you can do. Human judgment still matters.

## Healthcare Applications {.center}

- ML works with structured data across many contexts:
    - Predicting future admissions from past admissions and primary care data
    - Allocating resources efficiently by forecasting future demand
- ML also works well with unstructured data:
    - Diagnosing diabetic retinopathy using eye scans
    - Extracting predictions from handwritten clinician notes

## How Does Machine Learning Work? {.center}

- The core idea:
    - Show the system labeled examples
    - The system learns patterns from these examples
    - Then predicts outcomes for new examples
- This is called **supervised learning**.

## Supervised Learning {.center}

- Training a model on data where the outcome is already known and labeled, to predict outcomes on new data.
- You provide: 
    - **Features** (input variables): age, diagnosis, lab results
    - **Target** (what to predict): readmitted yes/no
- The model learns the relationship between the features and the target.

## The Basic Workflow {.center}

1. Get data with examples and labels
2. Split into training and testing sets
3. Train a model on training data
4. Make predictions on test data
5. Evaluate how well it performed
