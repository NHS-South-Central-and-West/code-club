We believe these skills are indispensable to the NHS today and in the future, enabling the delivery of high-quality insights through data science and advanced analytics, and the automation of day-to-day tasks with programming. We want to foster an environment that welcomes everybody, sparks ideas, and nurtures collaboration.\nThe Code Club syllabus has been designed to help people with little to no coding experience develop their skills in Python and extend their analytical skills through code. Sessions will be an hour long and held once per fortnight at 2:00 PM on Thursdays. To get an idea of what we will be covering and see if it is right for you, go to the Schedule page. We would love for you to join us!"

    "text": "Visualising a Single Variable\n\nWhat do we want to know when we are visualising a sample taken from a single variable?\nWe want to understand the value that the value tends to take, and how much it tends to deviate from its typical value.\n\nThe central tendency and deviation are ways to describe a sample.\nVisualising the distribution of a variable can tell us these things (approximately), and can tell us about the shape of the data too.\n\n\n\nDescribing a Sample\n\nWhat is the best way to describe a variable?\n\nWhat is the average value? Or the value it is most likely to take? What is the best value to describe it in one go?\n\nThe “central tendency” is the average or most common value that a variable takes. Mean, median, and mode are all descriptions of the central tendency.\n\nMean - Sum of values in a sample divided by the total number of observations\nMedian - The midpoint value if the sample is ordered from highest to lowest\nMode - The most common value in the sample\n\nThe mean is the most common approach, but the mean, median, and mode choice are context-dependent. Other approaches exist, too, such as the geometric mean.\n\nThe geometric mean multiplies all values in the sample and takes the \\(n\\)th root of that multiplied value.\nIt can be useful when dealing with skewed data or data with very large ranges, and when dealing with rates, proportions etc. However it can’t handle zeros or negative values.\n\nThe mode value is generally most useful when dealing with categorical variables.\n\n\n# mode rainfall by location\nbig_cities.groupby('Location')['Rainfall'].agg(pd.Series.mode)\n\nLocation\nAdelaide     0.0\nBrisbane     0.0\nMelbourne    0.0\nPerth        0.0\nSydney       0.0\nName: Rainfall, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n# mode location\nbig_cities['Location'].agg(pd.Series.mode)\n\n0    Sydney\nName: Location, dtype: object\n\n\n\n# mode location using value counts\nbig_cities['Location'].value_counts().iloc[0:1]\n\nLocation\nSydney    3344\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\n# mean rainfall by location\nnp.round(big_cities.groupby('Location')['Rainfall'].mean(), decimals=2)\n\nLocation\nAdelaide     1.57\nBrisbane     3.14\nMelbourne    1.87\nPerth        1.91\nSydney       3.32\nName: Rainfall, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n# median rainfall by location\nbig_cities.groupby('Location')['Rainfall'].median()\n\nLocation\nAdelaide     0.0\nBrisbane     0.0\nMelbourne    0.0\nPerth        0.0\nSydney       0.0\nName: Rainfall, dtype: float64\n\n\n\n# geometric mean max temperature by location\nbig_cities.groupby('Location')['MaxTemp'].apply(lambda x: np.exp(np.log(x).mean()))\n\nLocation\nAdelaide     21.888697\nBrisbane     26.152034\nMelbourne    19.972352\nPerth        24.320203\nSydney       22.570993\nName: MaxTemp, dtype: float64\n\n\n\nWhy do the mean and median differ so much? Why would the median rainfall be zero for all five cities?\nDoes this matter? How would it change our understanding of the rainfall variable?\nVisualising the distribution can tell us more!\n\n\n\nComparing the Mean & Median\n\nWe have simulated three different distributions that have slightly different shapes. and see how their mean and median values differ.\n\n\n# generate distributions\nnp.random.seed(123)\nnormal_dist = np.random.normal(10, 1, 1000)\nright_skewed_dist = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(8, 2, 600), np.random.normal(14, 4, 400)])\nleft_skewed_dist = np.concatenate([np.random.normal(14, 2, 600), np.random.normal(8, 4, 400)])\n\n\n# import packages\nimport warnings\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# control some deprecation warnings in seaborn\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\n    \"ignore\",\n    category=FutureWarning,\n    module=\"seaborn\"\n)\n\n# set figure size\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (12, 6)\n\n# function for calculating summary statistics and plotting distributions\ndef plot_averages(ax, data, title):\n    mean = np.mean(data)\n    median = np.median(data)\n    \n    sns.histplot(data, color=\"#d9dcd6\", bins=30, ax=ax)\n    ax.axvline(mean, color=\"#0081a7\", linewidth=3, linestyle=\"--\", label=f\"Mean: {mean:.2f}\")\n    ax.axvline(median, color=\"#ef233c\", linewidth=3, linestyle=\"--\", label=f\"Median: {median:.2f}\")\n    ax.set_title(title)\n    ax.set_ylabel('')\n    ax.legend()\n\n\n# plot distributions\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 3, sharey=True)\n\nplot_averages(axes[0], normal_dist, \"Normal Distribution\\n(Mean ≈ Median)\")\nplot_averages(axes[1], right_skewed_dist, \"Right-Skewed Distribution\\n(Mean &gt; Median)\")\nplot_averages(axes[2], left_skewed_dist, \"Left-Skewed Distribution\\n(Mean &lt; Median)\")\n\nplt.suptitle(\"Comparison of Mean & Median Across Distributions\", fontsize=16)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean and median of the normal distribution are identical, while the two skewed distributions have slightly different means and medians.\n\nThe mean is larger than the media when the distribution is right-skewed, and the median is larger than the mean when it is left-skewed.\nWhen the distribution is skewed, the median value will be a better description of the central tendency, because the mean value is more sensitive to extreme values (and skewed distributions have longer tails of extreme values).\n\nThese differences point to another important factor to consider when summarising data - the spread or deviation of the sample.\nHow do we measure how a sample is spread around the central tendency?\n\nStandard deviation and variance quantify spread.\nVariance, the average squared difference between observations and the mean value, measures how spread out a sample is.\nStandard deviation is the square root of the variance.

If it does not, run cd ~, and it should return to your home directory. We recommend the use of a single folder to hold your python projects while learning, because we will be using git version control we will call this “Git”. we can use the command mkdir code_club to make this folder and then use cd code_club to relocate to this folder1.\nWe will create a new uv project in this directory using the command uv init. The new project will contain everything we need, including a Python installation, a virtual environment, and the necessary project files for tracking and managing any packages installed in the virtual environment. To set up a new project called test-project, use the following command:\nuv init test_project\nHaving created this new directory, navigate to it using cd test_project.\nFor this session you will need to add 3 Python packages, ipykernel2, pandas and seaborn We can use the following command:\nuv add ipykernel pandas seaborn\nWe are going to create a blank notebook in this file by running the command new-item first_notebook.ipynb if you now run ls you will note this file has been created\nYour Python project is now set up, and you are ready to start writing some code. You can open VS Code from your PowerShell window by running code ..\n\nOpening your project in VS Code\nYou could also do this from within VS Code as most IDEs include a terminal interface which will be demonstrated in session.\nFor now launch VS Code and click File &gt; Open Folder.... You’ll want to make sure you select the root level of your project. Once you’ve opened the folder, the file navigation pane in VS Code should display the files that uv has created, as well as the notebook you created: first_notebook.ipynb. Click on this to open it.\nOnce VS Code realises you’ve opened a folder with Python code and a virtual environment, it should do the following:\n\nSuggest you install the Python extension (and, once you’ve created a Jupyter notebook, the Jupyter one) offered by Microsoft - go ahead and do this. If this doesn’t happen, you can install extensions manually from the Extensions pane on the left-hand side.\nSelect the uv-created .venv as the python Environment we’re going to use to actually run our code. If this doesn’t happen, press ctrl-shift-P, type “python environment” to find the Python - Create Environment... option, hit enter, choose “Venv” and proceed to “Use Existing”.\n\nIf VS Code has found the virtual environment, it may pick up the correct kernel. If not you may need to select this manually this can be done by clicking in the top right where you can see Select Kernel (see below)\n\n\n\nClick ‘Select Kernel’\n\n\nWe can then select the appropriate kernel from python environments and looking for\n\n\n\nclick Python Environments\n\n\n\n\n\nclick venv - recommended\n\n\nOnce the kernel is enabled you are ready to start adding cells to your notebook. these can either be code cells which is where you include your program elements or markdown which enable the addition of headings, analysis and commentary.",

    "text": "The Tools You Will Need\nWhile this course focuses on Python, we will use several other tools throughout.\n\nLanguage: Python\nDependency Management & Virtual Environments: uv\nVersion Control: Git, GitHub Desktop\nIDE: VS Code/Jupyter Notebooks (or your preferred IDE)\n\nYou can install all the tools you’ll need by running the following one-liner run in PowerShell:\nwinget install astral-sh.uv Microsoft.VisualStudioCode github-desktop\n\nPython\nPython is an all-purpose programming language that is one of, if not the most popular, in the world1 and is widely used in almost every industry. Its popularity is owed to its flexibility as a language that can be used to achieve nearly any job. It is often referred to as the second-best tool for every job. Specialist languages might be better for specific tasks (for example, R for statistics), but Python is good at everything.\nIt is a strong choice for data science and analytics, being one of the best languages for data wrangling, data visualisation, statistics, and machine learning. It is also well-suited to web development, scientific computing, and automation.\n\n\nDependency Management\nOne of Python’s greatest weaknesses is dependency management. Despite its many strengths, there is no escaping the dependency hell that every Python user faces.\nDependency management refers to the process of tracking and managing all of the packages (dependencies) a project needs to run. It is a consideration in any programming language. It ensures:\n\nThe right packages are installed.\nThe correct versions are used.\nConflicts between packages are avoided.\n\nThere are many reasons that Python handles dependency management so poorly, but there are some tools that make this a little easier on users. We are using uv for dependency management. It is relatively new, but it is quickly becoming the consensus tool for dependency management in Python because it makes the process about as painless as it can be without moving to a different language entirely.\n\nVirtual Environments\nVirtual environments are a component of dependency management. Dependency management becomes much messier when you have many Python projects, each using their own packages, some overlapping and some requiring specific versions, either for compatibility or functionality reasons. Reducing some of this friction by isolating each project in its own virtual environment, like each project is walled off from all other projects, makes dependency management a little easier. Virtual environments allow you to manage dependencies for a specific project without the state of those dependencies affecting other projects or your wider system.\nVirtual environments help by:\n\nKeeping dependencies separate for each project.\nAvoiding version conflicts between projects.\nMaking dependency management more predictable and reproducible.\n\nWe will use uv to manage all dependencies, virtual environments, and even versions of Python.\n\n\n\nVersion Control\nVersion control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code or files over time, allowing you to:\n\nRevert to earlier versions if needed.\nCollaborate with others on the same project easily.\nMaintain a history of changes.\n\nWe are using Git, a version control system, to host our work and GitHub Desktop to manage version control locally.\nVersion control and Git are topics entirely in their own right, and covering them in detail is out of the scope of this session. We hope to cover version control in a future session, but right now, you just need to be able to access materials for these sessions. You can find the materials in the Code Club repository.\nIf you have downloaded GitHub Desktop, the easiest way to access these materials and keep up-to-date is by cloning the Code Club repository (go to File, then Clone Repository, select URL, and paste the Code Club repository link in the URL field). You can then ensure that the materials you are using are the most current by clicking the Fetch Origin button in GitHub Desktop, which grabs the changes we’ve made from the central repository on GitHub.\n\n\nIDE\nIDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are software that simplifies programming and development by combining many of the most common tasks and helpful features for programming into a single tool. These typically include a code editor, debugging functionality, build tools, and features like syntax highlighting and code completion. When you start your code journey, you might not need all these tools, and fully-featured IDEs can be overwhelming. But as you become more comfortable with programming, all these different features will become very valuable.\nSome common IDEs that are used for Python include:\n\nVS Code\nPyCharm\nVim\nJupyter Notebooks/JupyterLab\nPositron\n\nWe will use VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks (which is not exactly an IDE but is similar).",

    "text": "Project Setup\nEvery new Python project should start with using uv to set up a virtual environment for the project to keep everything organised and reduce the risk of finding yourself in dependency hell.\nThe entire project setup process can be handled in the command line. We will use PowerShell for consistency.\nWhen you open a PowerShell window, it should open in your C drive (e.g.,  C:\\Users\\user.name). If it does not, run cd ~, and it should return to your home directory.\nWe will create a new uv project in the home directory2 using the command uv init. The new project will contain everything we need, including a Python installation, a virtual environment, and the necessary project files for tracking and managing any packages installed in the virtual environment. To set up a new project called test-project, use the following command:\nuv init test-project\nHaving created this new directory, navigate to it using cd test-project. You can check the files in a directory using the command ls. If you run this command, you will see three files in the project directory (hello.py, pyproject.toml, and README.md). The project doesn’t yet have a Python installation or a virtual environment, but this will be added when we add external Python packages.\nYou can install Python packages using the command uv add. We can add some common Python packages that we will use in most projects (pandas, numpy, seaborn, and ipykernel3) using the following command:\nuv add pandas numpy seaborn ipykernel\nThe output from this command will reference the Python installation used and the creation of a virtual environment directory .venv. Now, if you run ls, you will see two new items in the directory, uv.lock and .venv.\nYour Python project is now set up, and you are ready to start writing some code. You can open VS Code from your PowerShell window by running code ..\nFor more information about creating and managing projects using uv, check out the uv documentation.\n\nOpening your project in VS Code\nTo open your newly-created uv project in VS Code, launch the application and click File &gt; Open Folder.... You’ll want to make sure you select the root level of your project. Once you’ve opened the folder, the file navigation pane in VS Code should display the files that uv has created, including a main.py example file. Click on this to open it.\nOnce VS Code realises you’ve opened a folder with Python code and a virtual environment, it should do the following:\n\nSuggest you install the Python extension (and, once you’ve created a Jupyter notebook, the Jupyter one) offered by Microsoft - go ahead and do this. If this doesn’t happen, you can install extensions manually from the Extensions pane on the left-hand side.\nSelect the uv-created .venv as the python Environment we’re going to use to actually run our code. If this doesn’t happen, press ctrl-shift-P, type “python environment” to find the Python - Create Environment... option, hit enter, choose “Venv” and proceed to “Use Existing”.\n\nIf all has gone well, you should be able to hit the “play” icon in the top right to execute main.py. The Terminal pane should open up below and display something like Hello from (your-project-name)!.",

Storing projects like these on One Drive will create many unnecessary issues.↩︎\nStrictly speaking, we should install ipykernel as a development dependency (a dependency that is needed for any development but not when the project is put into production). In this case, we would add it by running uv add --dev ipykernel. However, in this case, it is simpler to just add it as a regular dependency, and it doesn’t harm.↩︎",

The starting point when you have just imported a new dataset is usually the pandas function pd.DataFrame.head(), which shows the top \\(n\\) rows of the dataset (by default it shows the top five rows).\n\n# view the top five rows\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nLocation\nMinTemp\nMaxTemp\nRainfall\nEvaporation\nSunshine\nWindGustDir\nWindGustSpeed\nWindDir9am\n...\nHumidity9am\nHumidity3pm\nPressure9am\nPressure3pm\nCloud9am\nCloud3pm\nTemp9am\nTemp3pm\nRainToday\nRainTomorrow\n\n\n\n\n0\n2008-12-01\nAlbury\n13.4\n22.9\n0.6\nNaN\nNaN\nW\n44.0\nW\n...\n71.0\n22.0\n1007.7\n1007.1\n8.0\nNaN\n16.9\n21.8\nNo\nNo\n\n\n1\n2008-12-02\nAlbury\n7.4\n25.1\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\nWNW\n44.0\nNNW\n...\n44.0\n25.0\n1010.6\n1007.8\nNaN\nNaN\n17.2\n24.3\nNo\nNo\n\n\n2\n2008-12-03\nAlbury\n12.9\n25.7\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\nWSW\n46.0\nW\n...\n38.0\n30.0\n1007.6\n1008.7\nNaN\n2.0\n21.0\n23.2\nNo\nNo\n\n\n3\n2008-12-04\nAlbury\n9.2\n28.0\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\nNE\n24.0\nSE\n...\n45.0\n16.0\n1017.6\n1012.8\nNaN\nNaN\n18.1\n26.5\nNo\nNo\n\n\n4\n2008-12-05\nAlbury\n17.5\n32.3\n1.0\nNaN\nNaN\nW\n41.0\nENE\n...\n82.0\n33.0\n1010.8\n1006.0\n7.0\n8.0\n17.8\n29.7\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n\n5 rows × 23 columns\n\n\n\nYou can also look at the bottom rows of the dataset, using pd.DataFrame.tail().

Such as the length of the dataset (len(), which can also be used to get the length of various Python objects), which tells us how many observations we have.\n\n# get the object length\nlen(df)\n\n145460\n\n\nAnother option is pd.DataFrame.shape(), which shows the length (number of rows) and width (number of columns).\n\n# get the object shape (number of rows, number of columns)\ndf.shape\n\n(145460, 23)\n\n\nSpeaking of columns, if we want a quick list of the column names, we can get this using pd.DataFrame.columns().\n\n# get all column names\ndf.columns\n\nIndex(['Date', 'Location', 'MinTemp', 'MaxTemp', 'Rainfall', 'Evaporation',\n       'Sunshine', 'WindGustDir', 'WindGustSpeed', 'WindDir9am', 'WindDir3pm',\n       'WindSpeed9am', 'WindSpeed3pm', 'Humidity9am', 'Humidity3pm',\n       'Pressure9am', 'Pressure3pm', 'Cloud9am', 'Cloud3pm', 'Temp9am',\n       'Temp3pm', 'RainToday', 'RainTomorrow'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\nA quick and easy way to get some valuable information about the dataset is pd.DataFrame.info(), including the total non-null observations and data type1 of each column.\n\n# get dataframe info (column indices, non-null counts, data types)\ndf.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 145460 entries, 0 to 145459\nData columns (total 23 columns):\n #

    "text": "Exploring Variables (Columns) & Observations (Rows)\nIf we are going to narrow our focus to specific variables or groups of observations, we need to know how to select columns, filter values, and group the data. There are lots of different ways we can slice up the data. We won’t cover all of them here2, but we will try to cover a range that helps illustrate how pandas works and will help you build the intuition for working with data in pandas.\nWe can select columns in a variety of ways, but the “correct” way to select columns in most circumstances is using selection brackets (the square brackets []), also known as the indexing operator.\n\n# selecting a single column by name\ndf['Date']\n\n# alternative ways to select columns\n# df.loc[:, 'Date']\n# df.Date\n\n0         2008-12-01\n1         2008-12-02\n2         2008-12-03\n3         2008-12-04\n4         2008-12-05\n             ...    \n145455    2017-06-21\n145456    2017-06-22\n145457    2017-06-23\n145458    2017-06-24\n145459    2017-06-25\nName: Date, Length: 145460, dtype: object\n\n\nIf we want to select multiple columns, we can use double squared brackets ([[ ]]). This is the same process as before, but the inner brackets define a list, and the outer are the selection brackets.\n\n# selecting multiple columns (and all rows) by name\ndf[['Date', 'Location', 'Rainfall']]\n# df.loc[:, ['Date', 'Location', 'Rainfall']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nLocation\nRainfall\n\n\n\n\n0\n2008-12-01\nAlbury\n0.6\n\n\n1\n2008-12-02\nAlbury\n0.0\n\n\n2\n2008-12-03\nAlbury\n0.0\n\n\n3\n2008-12-04\nAlbury\n0.0\n\n\n4\n2008-12-05\nAlbury\n1.0\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n145455\n2017-06-21\nUluru\n0.0\n\n\n145456\n2017-06-22\nUluru\n0.0\n\n\n145457\n2017-06-23\nUluru\n0.0\n\n\n145458\n2017-06-24\nUluru\n0.0\n\n\n145459\n2017-06-25\nUluru\n0.0\n\n\n\n\n145460 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\nWhile selection brackets are a quick and easy solution if we want to grab a subset of variables in the dataset, it is realy only intended to be used for simple operations using only column selection.\nFor row selection, we should use pd.DataFrame.iloc[]. The iloc function is used for “integer position” selection, which means you can select rows or columns using their integer position. For rows 10-15, you can select them using the following:\n\n# slicing by rows\ndf.iloc[10:16]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nLocation\nMinTemp\nMaxTemp\nRainfall\nEvaporation\nSunshine\nWindGustDir\nWindGustSpeed\nWindDir9am\n...\nHumidity9am\nHumidity3pm\nPressure9am\nPressure3pm\nCloud9am\nCloud3pm\nTemp9am\nTemp3pm\nRainToday\nRainTomorrow\n\n\n\n\n10\n2008-12-11\nAlbury\n13.4\n30.4\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\nN\n30.0\nSSE\n...\n48.0\n22.0\n1011.8\n1008.7\nNaN\nNaN\n20.4\n28.8\nNo\nYes\n\n\n11\n2008-12-12\nAlbury\n15.9\n21.7\n2.2\nNaN\nNaN\nNNE\n31.0\nNE\n...\n89.0\n91.0\n1010.5\n1004.2\n8.0\n8.0\n15.9\n17.0\nYes\nYes\n\n\n12\n2008-12-13\nAlbury\n15.9\n18.6\n15.6\nNaN\nNaN\nW\n61.0\nNNW\n...\n76.0\n93.0\n994.3\n993.0\n8.0\n8.0\n17.4\n15.8\nYes\nYes\n\n\n13\n2008-12-14\nAlbury\n12.6\n21.0\n3.6\nNaN\nNaN\nSW\n44.0\nW\n...\n65.0\n43.0\n1001.2\n1001.8\nNaN\n7.0\n15.8\n19.8\nYes\nNo\n\n\n14\n2008-12-15\nAlbury\n8.4\n24.6\n0.0\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nS\n...\n57.0\n32.0\n1009.7\n1008.7\nNaN\nNaN\n15.9\n23.5\nNo\nNaN\n\n\n15\n2008-12-16\nAlbury\n9.8\n27.7\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\nWNW\n50.0\nNaN\n...\n50.0\n28.0\n1013.4\n1010.3\n0.0\nNaN\n17.3\n26.2\nNaN\nNo\n\n\n\n\n6 rows × 23 columns\n\n\n\nWe can do similar using a column’s integer position, but we have to select all rows (:) first:\n\n# using iloc with columns\ndf.iloc[:, 20]\n\n0         21.8\n1         24.3\n2         23.2\n3         26.5\n4         29.7\n          ... \n145455    22.4\n145456    24.5\n145457    26.1\n145458    26.0\n145459    20.9\nName: Temp3pm, Length: 145460, dtype: float64\n\n\nFinally, we can put both together to take a subset of both rows and columns:\n\n# using iloc with rows and columns\ndf.iloc[10:16, 20]\n\n10    28.8\n11    17.0\n12    15.8\n13    19.8\n14    23.5\n15    26.2\nName: Temp3pm, dtype: float64\n\n\nHowever, selecting by integer position is relatively limited. It is more likely we would want to subset the data based on the values of certain columns. We can filter rows by condition using pd.DataFrame.loc[].

We can use pd.DataFrame.nunique() to do this.\n\n# count unique values\ndf['Location'].nunique()\n\n49\n\n\nWe may also be interested in the locations themselves, which may tell us more about the spatial distribution of our data. In this case, we can use pd.DataFrame.unique().\n\n# get unique values\ndf['Location'].unique()\n\narray(['Albury', 'BadgerysCreek', 'Cobar', 'CoffsHarbour', 'Moree',\n       'Newcastle', 'NorahHead', 'NorfolkIsland', 'Penrith', 'Richmond',\n       'Sydney', 'SydneyAirport', 'WaggaWagga', 'Williamtown',\n       'Wollongong', 'Canberra', 'Tuggeranong', 'MountGinini', 'Ballarat',\n       'Bendigo', 'Sale', 'MelbourneAirport', 'Melbourne', 'Mildura',\n       'Nhil', 'Portland', 'Watsonia', 'Dartmoor', 'Brisbane', 'Cairns',\n       'GoldCoast', 'Townsville', 'Adelaide', 'MountGambier', 'Nuriootpa',\n       'Woomera', 'Albany', 'Witchcliffe', 'PearceRAAF', 'PerthAirport',\n       'Perth', 'SalmonGums', 'Walpole', 'Hobart', 'Launceston',\n       'AliceSprings', 'Darwin', 'Katherine', 'Uluru'], dtype=object)\n\n\nAnother common operation we might look to do is calculating the mean value (pd.DataFrame.mean()) of a certain variable. What is the average value of sunshine across the entire dataset?\n\n# calculate variable mean\ndf['Sunshine'].mean()\n\nnp.float64(7.6111775206611565)\n\n\nThis gives us the mean to many decimal places, and we probably don’t need to know the average sunshine hours to this level of precision. We can use the pd.DataFrame.round() function to round to two decimal places.\n\n# round mean value\ndf['Sunshine'].mean().round(2)\n\nnp.float64(7.61)\n\n\nMany operations will return the value with information about the object’s type included. The above values are wrapped in np.float64() because pd.DataFrame.mean() uses numpy to calculate the mean value. However, if you want to strip this information out so you only see the value itself, you can use print().\n\n# print mean value\nprint(df['Sunshine'].mean().round(2))\n\n7.61\n\n\nWhile we are often interested in the mean value when we talk about averages, we might want to know the median instead (pd.DataFrame.median()).\n\n# calculate other summary statistics\nprint(df['Sunshine'].median())\n\n8.4\n\n\nAnother common calculation is summing values (pd.DataFrame.sum()). We can use sum() to see the total hours of sunshine in our dataset, and we can use int() to convert this value to an integer (which also means we don’t need to use print()3).\n\n# calculate sum value and return an integer\nint(df['Sunshine'].sum())\n\n575595\n\n\nWe can also apply these summary operations on multiple variables, using the same selection logic as before (using double squared brackets).\n\nprint(df[['Sunshine', 'Rainfall']].mean())\n\nSunshine    7.611178\nRainfall    2.360918\ndtype: float64\n\n\nAnd we can apply multiple functions, using pd.DataFrame.agg().\n\ndf['Sunshine'].agg(['mean', 'median', 'sum']).round(1)\n\nmean           7.6\nmedian         8.4\nsum       575595.3\nName: Sunshine, dtype: float64\n\n\nThe next step when exploring specific variables will often be group-level summaries. The average amount of sunshine across the whole dataset has limited utility, but the average hours of sunshine in each location allows us to compare between locations and start to understand how different variables are related to each other. If we want to do a group-level operation, we have to use pd.DataFrame.groupby().\n\n# calculate group means\ndf.groupby(by='Location')['Sunshine'].mean().round(1)\n\nLocation\nAdelaide            7.7\nAlbany              6.7\nAlbury              NaN\nAliceSprings        9.6\nBadgerysCreek       NaN\nBallarat            NaN\nBendigo             NaN\nBrisbane            8.1\nCairns              7.6\nCanberra            7.4\nCobar               8.7\nCoffsHarbour        7.4\nDartmoor            6.5\nDarwin              8.5\nGoldCoast           NaN\nHobart              6.6\nKatherine           NaN\nLaunceston          NaN\nMelbourne           6.4\nMelbourneAirport    6.4\nMildura             8.5\nMoree               8.9\nMountGambier        6.5\nMountGinini         NaN\nNewcastle           NaN\nNhil                NaN\nNorahHead           NaN\nNorfolkIsland       7.0\nNuriootpa           7.7\nPearceRAAF          8.8\nPenrith             NaN\nPerth               8.8\nPerthAirport        8.8\nPortland            6.5\nRichmond            NaN\nSale                6.7\nSalmonGums          NaN\nSydney              7.2\nSydneyAirport       7.2\nTownsville          8.5\nTuggeranong         NaN\nUluru               NaN\nWaggaWagga          8.2\nWalpole             NaN\nWatsonia            6.4\nWilliamtown         7.2\nWitchcliffe         NaN\nWollongong          NaN\nWoomera             9.0\nName: Sunshine, dtype: float64\n\n\nThe groupby(by='Location') function tells us the grouping variable (location), then we select the variable we want to summarise by location (sunshine), and then we specify the operation (mean).\nThere are multiple locations that return NaN (Not a Number). This indicates that numpy was unable to calculate a mean value for those locations. This is likely to be because all sunshine values for those locations are null.\nWe can check this using pd.DataFrame.count(), which counts the total non-null values (whereas pd.DataFrame.size() counts the total values).\n\n# group by location and count non-null sunshine values\ndf.groupby('Location')['Sunshine'].count()\n\nLocation\nAdelaide            1769\nAlbany              2520\nAlbury                 0\nAliceSprings        2520\nBadgerysCreek          0\nBallarat               0\nBendigo                0\nBrisbane            3144\nCairns              2564\nCanberra            1521\nCobar                550\nCoffsHarbour        1494\nDartmoor            2566\nDarwin              3189\nGoldCoast              0\nHobart              3179\nKatherine              0\nLaunceston             0\nMelbourne           3192\nMelbourneAirport    3008\nMildura             2876\nMoree               2055\nMountGambier        2597\nMountGinini            0\nNewcastle              0\nNhil                   0\nNorahHead              0\nNorfolkIsland       2570\nNuriootpa           2848\nPearceRAAF          3004\nPenrith                0\nPerth               3188\nPerthAirport        3004\nPortland            2566\nRichmond               0\nSale                1818\nSalmonGums             0\nSydney              3328\nSydneyAirport       2993\nTownsville          2617\nTuggeranong            0\nUluru                  0\nWaggaWagga          2575\nWalpole                0\nWatsonia            3008\nWilliamtown         1355\nWitchcliffe            0\nWollongong             0\nWoomera             2007\nName: Sunshine, dtype: int64\n\n\nThe results show that all the locations that return NaN in our group mean calculation have zero non-null values.",

    "text": "Transforming Data\nDatasets are rarely perfectly clean and tidy. We often need to transform the data before we can get the most out of it.\nQuestions:\n\nWhat sort of transformations would help us get the most out of the analysis of the Australian weather data?\n\nThe first step with any analysis is often converting columns to the correct types. With a longitudinal (time-series) dataset,the date column is a good place to start. We can use pd.DataFrame.dtypes to check the data type, either of a single column (using the selector brackets) or all columns in the dataset.\n\nprint(df.dtypes)\n\nDate              object\nLocation          object\nMinTemp          float64\nMaxTemp          float64\nRainfall         float64\nEvaporation      float64\nSunshine         float64\nWindGustDir       object\nWindGustSpeed    float64\nWindDir9am        object\nWindDir3pm        object\nWindSpeed9am     float64\nWindSpeed3pm     float64\nHumidity9am      float64\nHumidity3pm      float64\nPressure9am      float64\nPressure3pm      float64\nCloud9am         float64\nCloud3pm         float64\nTemp9am          float64\nTemp3pm          float64\nRainToday         object\nRainTomorrow      object\ndtype: object\n\n\nAll columns are either stored as object or float64. The object data type is for generic non-numeric data, but from the columns that are stored as objects, we can tell this is mostly categorical variables where the categories are represented as text. The float64 data type refers to data that is numeric and includes decimals (float64 = 64-bit floating point number).\nThe date column is stored as an object, but pandas can store dates as datetime64. We can convert dates using pd.to_datetime(). When transforming data, if we want to keep those transformations, we have to store those changes, using =. In this case, we want to convert the date column but we don’t want to create an entirely new dataframe to handle this change, so we can overwrite the current date column by using the selection brackets to identify the column we want to apply this change to.\n\n# convert date column to datetime\ndf['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])\n\nThe remaining object columns can be converted to categorical, which makes them easier to work with in subsequent analyses. We can use pd.DataFrame.astype() to convert column data types.\n\n# create a list of all object columns\nobject_cols = ['Location', 'WindGustDir', 'WindDir9am', 'WindDir3pm', 'RainToday', 'RainTomorrow']\n\n# convert object columns to category\ndf[object_cols] = df[object_cols].astype('category')\n\nA more efficient, though synactically more complex, way of doing this is using lamda functions. We won’t cover lambda functons in this session (they will be discussed in detail in a future session), but below is how we can use them to convert objects to categories.\n\n# convert object columns to category data type\ndf = df.apply(lambda x: x.astype('category') if x.dtype == 'object' else x)\n\nAnother choice we might make is to remove missing values, using pd.DataFrame.dropna() to filter the null values and keep only the non-null values. We can use this to drop all null values across the entire dataset, or we can apply it to a subset of columns, using the subset argument.\n\n# filter observations where sunshine is NA\ndf.dropna(subset='Sunshine')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDate\nLocation\nMinTemp\nMaxTemp\nRainfall\nEvaporation\nSunshine\nWindGustDir\nWindGustSpeed\nWindDir9am\n...\nHumidity9am\nHumidity3pm\nPressure9am\nPressure3pm\nCloud9am\nCloud3pm\nTemp9am\nTemp3pm\nRainToday\nRainTomorrow\n\n\n\n\n6049\n2009-01-01\nCobar\n17.9\n35.2\n0.0\n12.0\n12.3\nSSW\n48.0\nENE\n...\n20.0\n13.0\n1006.3\n1004.4\n2.0\n5.0\n26.6\n33.4\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6050\n2009-01-02\nCobar\n18.4\n28.9\n0.0\n14.8\n13.0\nS\n37.0\nSSE\n...\n30.0\n8.0\n1012.9\n1012.1\n1.0\n1.0\n20.3\n27.0\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6051\n2009-01-03\nCobar\n15.5\n34.1\n0.0\n12.6\n13.3\nSE\n30.0\nNaN\n...\nNaN\n7.0\nNaN\n1011.6\nNaN\n1.0\nNaN\n32.7\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6052\n2009-01-04\nCobar\n19.4\n37.6\n0.0\n10.8\n10.6\nNNE\n46.0\nNNE\n...\n42.0\n22.0\n1012.3\n1009.2\n1.0\n6.0\n28.7\n34.9\nNo\nNo\n\n\n6053\n2009-01-05\nCobar\n21.9\n38.4\n0.0\n11.4\n12.2\nWNW\n31.0\nWNW\n...\n37.0\n22.0\n1012.7\n1009.1\n1.0\n5.0\n29.1\n35.6\nNo\nNo\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n142298\n2017-06-20\nDarwin\n19.3\n33.4\n0.0\n6.0\n11.0\nENE\n35.0\nSE\n...\n63.0\n32.0\n1013.9\n1010.5\n0.0\n1.0\n24.5\n32.3\nNo\nNo\n\n\n142299\n2017-06-21\nDarwin\n21.2\n32.6\n0.0\n7.6\n8.6\nE\n37.0\nSE\n...\n56.0\n28.0\n1014.6\n1011.2\n7.0\n0.0\n24.8\n32.0\nNo\nNo\n\n\n142300\n2017-06-22\nDarwin\n20.7\n32.8\n0.0\n5.6\n11.0\nE\n33.0\nE\n...\n46.0\n23.0\n1015.3\n1011.8\n0.0\n0.0\n24.8\n32.1\nNo\nNo\n\n\n142301\n2017-06-23\nDarwin\n19.5\n31.8\n0.0\n6.2\n10.6\nESE\n26.0\nSE\n...\n62.0\n58.0\n1014.9\n1010.7\n1.0\n1.0\n24.8\n29.2\nNo\nNo\n\n\n142302\n2017-06-24\nDarwin\n20.2\n31.7\n0.0\n5.6\n10.7\nENE\n30.0\nENE\n...\n73.0\n32.0\n1013.9\n1009.7\n6.0\n5.0\n25.4\n31.0\nNo\nNo\n\n\n\n\n75625 rows × 23 columns\n\n\n\nWe haven’t stored this transformation, because filtering nulls without careful consideration is a bad idea, but it’s useful to know, nonetheless.\nThere are lots of ways we could transform the data, but the final example we will consider here is reshaping the data using pd.DataFrame.pivot(), which transforms the data from long to wide format data, and pd.DataFrame.melt(), which transforms it from wide to long format.\nPerhaps we want to focus on the maximum temperature per day in each location in 2015.

    "text": "Data manipulation\n\nColumn conversions\nBefore we start actually generating some visuals, we need to make sure our Date column contains proper datetimes. We’re also going to drop the years with partial data so that our dataset only has full years. Finally we’re going to change the RainTomorrow field to contain a 0 or a 1 rather than yes/no.\n\n# convert date column to datetime\ndf['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['Date'])\n\n# create a column that just contains the year\ndf['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year\n\n# drop the partial years (2007,2017)\ndf = df[~df['Year'].isin([2007,2017])]\n\n# convert 'RainTomorrow' to a numeric variable, where 'Yes' = 1 and 'No' = 0.\ndf['RainToday']=df['RainToday'].replace({'Yes': 1, 'No': 0, 'NA':0}).fillna(0).astype(int)\ndf['RainTomorrow']=df['RainTomorrow'].map({'Yes': 1, 'No': 0,'NA': 0}).fillna(0).astype(int); \n\n# little tip: the semicolon suppresses textual output when we don't want it\n\n\n\nSort order and other helper tables\nWe need a month order for our “mmm” months - there is probably an official way of doing this…\n\nmonth_order = ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec']\n\nWe also need a sort order for our city names to use as a column order for some of our charts later. We’ll just arrange them alphabetically.\n\ncolOrder_top5Cities=['Adelaide','Brisbane','Melbourne','Perth','Sydney']\n\nTo enhance a chart we’re going to build later, we’re going to dynamically calculate some text describing our data range.\n\n# Calculate the date range dynamically; we're going to use this later...\ndate_min = df['Date'].min().strftime('%Y')\ndate_max = df['Date'].max().strftime('%Y')\ndate_range = f\"{date_min} - {date_max}\"\n\nprint(date_range)\n\n2008 - 2016\n\n\n\n\nPivoting and grouping\nNext, we’re going to create some helper dataframes by filtering, grouping and pivoting the data. These will be used for different types of visuals later. Of course, we could have just created these groupings and pivots inline when we do the actual visualisation, but we’re doing it this way because:\n\nIt’s easier to follow\nIt’s tidier (and probably faster) to create these dataframes once as we’re going to be using them multiple times.\n\n\n# build a month column\ndf['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.strftime('%b') # Add a column that just contains the month in mmm format\ndf['Month'] = pd.Categorical(df['Month'], categories=month_order, ordered=True) # Make it categorical using our custom order so that it appears in the right order\n\n# we're going to filter to top 5 cities from now on\ndf_top5Cities = df[df['Location'].isin(['Perth','Adelaide','Sydney','Melbourne','Brisbane'])]\n\n# a dataframe with the number of rainy days per year and month, and location\ndf_top5Cities_rainyDays = df_top5Cities.groupby(['Location','Year', 'Month'])['RainToday'].sum().reset_index()\n\n# finally, we're going to create some grouped and pivoted dataframes. Picture these as PivotTables in Excel.\ndf_top5Cities_Rainfall_grouped = df_top5Cities.groupby(['Location', 'Month'])['Rainfall'].mean().reset_index()\ndf_top5Cities_Rainfall_pivoted = df_top5Cities_Rainfall_grouped.pivot(index=\"Location\",columns=\"Month\", values=\"Rainfall\")\ndf_top5Cities_monthly_rainyDays_pivoted = df_top5Cities.groupby(['Location', 'Month','Year'])['RainToday'].sum().reset_index().groupby(['Location','Month'])['RainToday'].mean().reset_index().pivot(index=\"Location\",columns=\"Month\", values=\"RainToday\")\n\nLet’s use head() to make sure we understand what each grouped/pivoted DF is for.\n\ndf_top5Cities_Rainfall_grouped.head(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLocation\nMonth\nRainfall\n\n\n\n\n0\nAdelaide\nJan\n0.672199\n\n\n1\nAdelaide\nFeb\n0.973604\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_top5Cities_Rainfall_pivoted.head(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide\n0.672199\n0.973604\n1.171667\n1.461165\n2.293860\n2.447009\n2.873606\n2.399237\n1.809125\n0.906273\n0.730827\n1.192500\n\n\nBrisbane\n6.415574\n5.325389\n4.442276\n3.165385\n3.126446\n2.516318\n1.000000\n1.273381\n1.314498\n2.419424\n3.347761\n4.551613\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_top5Cities_monthly_rainyDays_pivoted.head(2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonth\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug\nSep\nOct\nNov\nDec\n\n\nLocation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdelaide\n2.555556\n1.555556\n3.666667\n4.000000\n7.666667\n8.555556\n13.444444\n11.444444\n7.888889\n4.222222\n4.000000\n4.555556\n\n\nBrisbane\n8.000000\n7.111111\n10.000000\n5.333333\n5.555556\n6.222222\n4.111111\n3.555556\n4.111111\n5.888889\n6.888889\n8.777778\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside: why df[df[...?\ndf_top5Cities = df[df['Location'].isin(['Perth','Adelaide','Sydney','Melbourne','Brisbane'])]\n\nThe first (outer) df[ tells pandas that we want to select a subset of rows based on some condition.\nThe second (inner) df[ is going to tell pandas this condition. In this case, we’re using isin to return a dataframe that contains a series of True and False rows corresponding to whether the rows in our original dataframe had the Location column as one of our 5 cities.\nThe final dataframe is then a filtered copy where the inner condition is True.\n\nYes, there are other ways of doing this! For example by using .query() to specify our conditions.",

    "text": "Doing some actual plotting\nThe Seaborn home page has a very good introductory tutorial, reference documentation, and a nice collection of examples. You should familiarise yourself with the documentation; it’ll pay off massively if you actually grasp what each function and argument is for, rather than just copy/pasting examples and tweaking them until they work (without really understanding what they’re doing).\n\nA basic one-line line chart\n\nsns.lineplot(\n  data=df_top5Cities_Rainfall_pivoted.T #.T gives the transpose (flips rows and columns)\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust a little bit of customisation - a bar chart\nhttps://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.barplot.html\n\nour_barplot = sns.barplot(\n  data=df_top5Cities_Rainfall_grouped \n  ,x=\"Month\"\n  ,y=\"Rainfall\"\n  ,hue=\"Location\" # read \"hue\" as \"series\"\n  ,palette=\"tab10\" # https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html\n  )\n\nour_barplot.set(title='Average daily rainfall by month and city')\n\nsns.move_legend(our_barplot,\"upper left\") # https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.move_legend.html\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn aside - why did we need to set the title after the sns.barplot call?\nThe barplot function provided by Seaborn doesn’t actually allow setting of a title - it just generates a plot (including its axes) and returns this as a matplotlib Axes object (recall we mentioned earlier that Seaborn is a layer on top of the matplotlib library). By using the .set(...) method on our barplot object, we can modify this returned object to give it a title. We also could have used this to customise our axis labels (the defaults are fine here), set axis limits, or things like tick labels.\n\n\n\nHeatmaps\n\n# We need to use some matplotlib code to set our output size, add a title, and capitalise our x-axis label\nf,ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(10, 5)) \nax.set_title(f\"Average daily rainfall (/mm) each month ({date_range}) for Australia's top 5 cities\", fontsize=16, fontweight=\"bold\", pad=10)\n\nsns.heatmap(df_top5Cities_Rainfall_pivoted # Heatmap expects rectangular (pivot-like) data\n            ,annot=True # Put numbers inside the cells\n            ,fmt=\".1f\" # Make the numbers have 1 decimal place\n            ,square=True # Square vs rectangular cells\n            ,cbar=False # Get rid of the colourbar legend on the side\n            ,cmap=\"Blues\" # Seems appropriate for rainfall.
