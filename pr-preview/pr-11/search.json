    "text": "Project Setup\nOur project set-up will follow the same steps as used in the onboarding session, by using uv to set up a new project folder.\nTo get started we will use PowerShell powershell to open a command prompt, it should open in your C drive (e.g., C:\\Users\\user.name). If it does not, run cd ~, and it should return to your home directory. We recommend the use of a single folder to hold your python projects while learning, because we will be using git version control we will call this “Git”. we can use the command mkdir code_club to make this folder and then use cd code_club to relocate to this folder1.\nWe will create a new uv project in this directory using the command uv init. The new project will contain everything we need, including a Python installation, a virtual environment, and the necessary project files for tracking and managing any packages installed in the virtual environment. To set up a new project called test-project, use the following command:\nuv init test_project\nHaving created this new directory, navigate to it using cd test_project.\nFor this session you will need to add 3 Python packages, ipykernel2, pandas and seaborn We can use the following command:\nuv add ipykernel pandas seaborn\nWe are going to create a blank notebook in this file by running the command new-item first_notebook.ipynb if you now run ls you will note this file has been created\nYour Python project is now set up, and you are ready to start writing some code. You can open VS Code from your PowerShell window by running code ..\n\nOpening your project in VS Code\nYou could also do this from within VS Code as most IDEs include a terminal interface which will be demonstrated in session.\nFor now launch VS Code and click File &gt; Open Folder.... You’ll want to make sure you select the root level of your project. Once you’ve opened the folder, the file navigation pane in VS Code should display the files that uv has created, as well as the notebook you created: first_notebook.ipynb. Click on this to open it.\nOnce VS Code realises you’ve opened a folder with Python code and a virtual environment, it should do the following:\n\nSuggest you install the Python extension (and, once you’ve created a Jupyter notebook, the Jupyter one) offered by Microsoft - go ahead and do this. If this doesn’t happen, you can install extensions manually from the Extensions pane on the left-hand side.\nSelect the uv-created .venv as the python Environment we’re going to use to actually run our code. If this doesn’t happen, press ctrl-shift-P, type “python environment” to find the Python - Create Environment... option, hit enter, choose “Venv” and proceed to “Use Existing”.\n\nIf VS Code has found the virtual environment, it may pick up the correct kernel. If not you may need to select this manually this can be done by clicking in the top right where you can see Select Kernel (see below)\n\n\n\nClick ‘Select Kernel’\n\n\nWe can then select the appropriate kernel from python environments and looking for\n\n\n\nclick Python Environments\n\n\n\n\n\nclick venv - recommended\n\n\nOnce the kernel is enabled you are ready to start adding cells to your notebook. these can either be code cells which is where you include your program elements or markdown which enable the addition of headings, analysis and commentary.",

You can frame a comparison between groups as analysing the relationship between the groups and the continuous variable, but you are still comparing the average value and dispersion for each group and inferring the relationship (or association) from this. When comparing two continuous variables, you can’t reduce either to their average, and are instead making statements about the way they vary together.\nQuestion: What relationships have you explored in your own work?",

There is clearly a very strong association between flipper length and body mass. However, we can’t claim that flipper length causes body mass just based off this. Correlation does not imply causation1.\nWhen we visualised the relationship between bill length and bill depth, there appeared to be a grouping structure going on that complicated things, and the overall relationship appeared pretty noisy.\n\nr, p = pearsonr(df['bill_len'], df['bill_dep'])\nprint(f\"Correlation (r) = {r:.2f}\")\n\nCorrelation (r) = -0.23\n\n\nAs a result, the correlation score is much lower. A correlation of -0.23 tells us two things:\n\nThe negative correlation means that when bill length increases, bill depth tends to decrease.\nThe weaker correlation suggests that this decrease is a lot noisier, and it is much harder to estimate a penguin’s bill depth using their bill length.\n\nA correlation of +/- ~0.2 doesn’t necessarily mean there is no relationship. There are lots of ways correlation can mislead, because it is a limited measure. Visualising the relationship between bill length and bill depth showed us that species is highly relevant, and not factoring this in limits what we can say about this relationship.\n\n\nCorrelation Matrix\nWe may be interested in the pairwise correlation between multiple variables. If so, computing each correlation between pairs of variables is very cumbersome.

    "section": "The Tools You Will Need",
    "text": "The Tools You Will Need\nWhile this course focuses on Python, we will use several other tools throughout.\n\nLanguage: Python\nDependency Management & Virtual Environments: uv\nVersion Control: Git, GitHub Desktop\nIDE: VS Code/Jupyter Notebooks (or your preferred IDE)\n\nYou can install all the tools you’ll need by running the following one-liner run in PowerShell:\nwinget install astral-sh.uv Microsoft.VisualStudioCode github-desktop\n\nPython\nPython is an all-purpose programming language that is one of, if not the most popular, in the world1 and is widely used in almost every industry. Its popularity is owed to its flexibility as a language that can be used to achieve nearly any job. It is often referred to as the second-best tool for every job. Specialist languages might be better for specific tasks (for example, R for statistics), but Python is good at everything.\nIt is a strong choice for data science and analytics, being one of the best languages for data wrangling, data visualisation, statistics, and machine learning. It is also well-suited to web development, scientific computing, and automation.\n\n\nDependency Management\nOne of Python’s greatest weaknesses is dependency management. Despite its many strengths, there is no escaping the dependency hell that every Python user faces.\nDependency management refers to the process of tracking and managing all of the packages (dependencies) a project needs to run. It is a consideration in any programming language. It ensures:\n\nThe right packages are installed.\nThe correct versions are used.\nConflicts between packages are avoided.\n\nThere are many reasons that Python handles dependency management so poorly, but there are some tools that make this a little easier on users. We are using uv for dependency management. It is relatively new, but it is quickly becoming the consensus tool for dependency management in Python because it makes the process about as painless as it can be without moving to a different language entirely.\n\nVirtual Environments\nVirtual environments are a component of dependency management. Dependency management becomes much messier when you have many Python projects, each using their own packages, some overlapping and some requiring specific versions, either for compatibility or functionality reasons. Reducing some of this friction by isolating each project in its own virtual environment, like each project is walled off from all other projects, makes dependency management a little easier. Virtual environments allow you to manage dependencies for a specific project without the state of those dependencies affecting other projects or your wider system.\nVirtual environments help by:\n\nKeeping dependencies separate for each project.\nAvoiding version conflicts between projects.\nMaking dependency management more predictable and reproducible.\n\nWe will use uv to manage all dependencies, virtual environments, and even versions of Python.\n\n\n\nVersion Control\nVersion control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to code or files over time, allowing you to:\n\nRevert to earlier versions if needed.\nCollaborate with others on the same project easily.\nMaintain a history of changes.\n\nWe are using Git, a version control system, to host our work and GitHub Desktop to manage version control locally.\nVersion control and Git are topics entirely in their own right, and covering them in detail is out of the scope of this session. We hope to cover version control in a future session, but right now, you just need to be able to access materials for these sessions. You can find the materials in the Code Club repository.\nIf you have downloaded GitHub Desktop, the easiest way to access these materials and keep up-to-date is by cloning the Code Club repository (go to File, then Clone Repository, select URL, and paste the Code Club repository link in the URL field). You can then ensure that the materials you are using are the most current by clicking the Fetch Origin button in GitHub Desktop, which grabs the changes we’ve made from the central repository on GitHub.\n\n\nIDE\nIDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are software that simplifies programming and development by combining many of the most common tasks and helpful features for programming into a single tool. These typically include a code editor, debugging functionality, build tools, and features like syntax highlighting and code completion. When you start your code journey, you might not need all these tools, and fully-featured IDEs can be overwhelming. But as you become more comfortable with programming, all these different features will become very valuable.\nSome common IDEs that are used for Python include:\n\nVS Code\nPyCharm\nVim\nJupyter Notebooks/JupyterLab\nPositron\n\nWe will use VS Code or Jupyter Notebooks (which is not exactly an IDE but is similar).",

    "text": "Project Setup\nEvery new Python project should start with using uv to set up a virtual environment for the project to keep everything organised and reduce the risk of finding yourself in dependency hell.\nThe entire project setup process can be handled in the command line. We will use PowerShell for consistency.\nWhen you open a PowerShell window, it should open in your C drive (e.g.,  C:\\Users\\user.name). If it does not, run cd ~, and it should return to your home directory.\nWe will create a new uv project in the home directory2 using the command uv init. The new project will contain everything we need, including a Python installation, a virtual environment, and the necessary project files for tracking and managing any packages installed in the virtual environment. To set up a new project called test-project, use the following command:\nuv init test-project\nHaving created this new directory, navigate to it using cd test-project. You can check the files in a directory using the command ls. If you run this command, you will see three files in the project directory (hello.py, pyproject.toml, and README.md). The project doesn’t yet have a Python installation or a virtual environment, but this will be added when we add external Python packages.\nYou can install Python packages using the command uv add. We can add some common Python packages that we will use in most projects (pandas, numpy, seaborn, and ipykernel3) using the following command:\nuv add pandas numpy seaborn ipykernel\nThe output from this command will reference the Python installation used and the creation of a virtual environment directory .venv. Now, if you run ls, you will see two new items in the directory, uv.lock and .venv.\nYour Python project is now set up, and you are ready to start writing some code. You can open VS Code from your PowerShell window by running code ..\nFor more information about creating and managing projects using uv, check out the uv documentation.\n\nOpening your project in VS Code\nTo open your newly-created uv project in VS Code, launch the application and click File &gt; Open Folder.... You’ll want to make sure you select the root level of your project. Once you’ve opened the folder, the file navigation pane in VS Code should display the files that uv has created, including a main.py example file. Click on this to open it.\nOnce VS Code realises you’ve opened a folder with Python code and a virtual environment, it should do the following:\n\nSuggest you install the Python extension (and, once you’ve created a Jupyter notebook, the Jupyter one) offered by Microsoft - go ahead and do this. If this doesn’t happen, you can install extensions manually from the Extensions pane on the left-hand side.\nSelect the uv-created .venv as the python Environment we’re going to use to actually run our code. If this doesn’t happen, press ctrl-shift-P, type “python environment” to find the Python - Create Environment... option, hit enter, choose “Venv” and proceed to “Use Existing”.\n\nIf all has gone well, you should be able to hit the “play” icon in the top right to execute main.py. The Terminal pane should open up below and display something like Hello from (your-project-name)!.",

Storing projects like these on One Drive will create many unnecessary issues.↩︎\nStrictly speaking, we should install ipykernel as a development dependency (a dependency that is needed for any development but not when the project is put into production). In this case, we would add it by running uv add --dev ipykernel. However, in this case, it is simpler to just add it as a regular dependency, and it doesn’t harm.↩︎",
