In the first session, we introduced machine learning conceptually and demonstrated a basic supervised learning workflow using logistic regression to predict survivors on the Titanic. This session builds on what was covered in the first session, exploring supervised learning in more detail, understanding the different approaches to supervising learning, and looking at some of the most common algorithms for supervised tasks.\n\n## Slides\n\nUse the left ⬅️ and right ➡️ arrow keys to navigate through the slides below.

You provide features (input variables) and a target (the outcome to predict), and the model learns the relationship between them. This differs from unsupervised learning, where no target exists and the goal is finding patterns or groupings, and from reinforcement learning, where the model learns through trial and error.\n\nThe fundamental structure of supervised learning involves features and targets. Features are the input variables that describe each observation: patient age, diagnosis codes, medication count, previous admissions. The target is what you want to predict: whether the patient will be readmitted, how long they'll stay, which treatment will work best. Features can be numerical (age, test results) or categorical (diagnosis, sex), and most algorithms handle both types.\n\nThere are two different kinds of supervised learning task, based on the target type:\n\n- Classification - Predicting categories (often binary outcomes). Will this patient be readmitted (yes/no), which diagnosis applies (A, B, C, D), is this scan normal or abnormal. \n- Regression - Predicting continuous numbers. How many days will the patient stay, what will next month's A&E attendances be, what's the predicted blood pressure. \n\nSome algorithms work for both tasks. Decision trees, for instance, can do classification by predicting the most common class in each leaf node, or regression by predicting the average value in each leaf.\n\nThe workflow we introduced in Session 1 applies to all supervised learning. Get labelled data, split into training and testing sets, train a model on training data, predict on test data, evaluate performance. The training/testing split is critical because it simulates real-world deployment. The model learns patterns from training data, then we test whether those patterns generalise to new data. Testing on training data would be dishonest: the model has already seen those examples and optimised for them.\n\nThe central challenge in supervised learning is generalisation. Models must learn patterns that work on new data, not just memorise the training set. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple and misses important patterns, performing poorly on both training and test data. Overfitting occurs when the model is too complex and learns noise in the training data, performing well on training data but poorly on test data. Finding the right complexity level is fundamental to building useful models.\n\n## Understanding How Models Learn\n\nWhen analysts first encounter machine learning, the training process often feels like magic. You pass data into a function, get a trained model back, and somehow it can make predictions. Understanding what happens during training transforms machine learning from magic into a tool you can control and apply effectively.\n\nDifferent algorithms approach learning in fundamentally different ways. Logistic regression finds linear boundaries that separate classes. Decision trees ask sequential yes/no questions. Random forests combine many trees to get more stable predictions. Gradient boosting builds trees that learn from previous mistakes. Each approach has strengths and weaknesses that make it better suited to different types of problems.\n\nThis matters in practice because there is no single best algorithm. The model that works best depends on your data structure, how much data you have, whether you need to explain predictions to clinicians, and what types of patterns exist in your features. Understanding how algorithms work lets you make informed choices about which to try and how to interpret their results.\n\n## Comparing Multiple Models\n\nWe'll train four different models on the Titanic dataset and compare their performance. This demonstrates how different algorithms learn different patterns from the same data.\n\n### Setup\n\nWe'll use the same libraries as Session 1, with additions for tree-based models and visualisation.\n\n::: {#setup .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier, plot_tree\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n\n# set random seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(42)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Data Preparation\n\nWe'll follow the same workflow as Session 1, preparing the Titanic dataset for modelling.\n\n::: {#load-and-prep-data .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# load titanic data\ndf = sns.load_dataset('titanic')\n\n# select features and target\nX = df[['pclass', 'sex', 'age', 'fare']]\ny = df['survived']\n\n# split into train and test sets\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42\n)\n\n# prepare features\ndef prepare_features(data):\n    data = data.copy()\n    data['age'] = data['age'].fillna(data['age'].median())\n    data['sex'] = (data['sex'] == 'female').astype(int)\n    return data\n\nX_train = prepare_features(X_train)\nX_test = prepare_features(X_test)\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Logistic Regression\n\nWe already covered logistic regression in Session 1. It finds a linear boundary that best separates survivors from non-survivors in feature space. Logistic regression works well when the relationship between features and outcomes is approximately linear, and it produces interpretable coefficients that show how each feature influences predictions.\n\n::: {#logistic-regression .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# train logistic regression\nlr_model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000, random_state=42)\nlr_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# evaluate on test set\nlr_pred = lr_model.predict(X_test)\nlr_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, lr_pred)\n\nprint(f\"Logistic Regression Accuracy: {lr_accuracy:.1%}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLogistic Regression Accuracy: 79.5%\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Decision Trees\n\nDecision trees learn by recursively splitting the data based on feature values. At each node, the tree asks a yes/no question about a feature and splits passengers into two groups. The algorithm chooses splits that best separate survivors from non-survivors, measured by metrics like Gini impurity[^Gini].\n\nThe tree continues splitting until it reaches stopping criteria: all passengers in a node have the same outcome, the node contains too few passengers to split further, or the tree reaches its maximum depth. The result is a series of rules that can be followed from root to leaf to make a prediction.\n\n::: {#decision-tree .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# train decision tree\ntree_model = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=3, random_state=42)\ntree_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# evaluate on test set\ntree_pred = tree_model.predict(X_test)\ntree_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, tree_pred)\n\nprint(f\"Decision Tree Accuracy: {tree_accuracy:.1%}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nDecision Tree Accuracy: 80.6%\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can visualise the tree structure to see exactly what rules it learned.\n\n::: {#cell-visualise-tree .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 10))\nplot_tree(\n    tree_model, \n    feature_names=X_train.columns,\n    class_names=['Died', 'Survived'],\n    filled=True,\n    fontsize=10\n)\nplt.title(\"Decision Tree Structure (max_depth=3)\")\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Decision tree showing splitting rules learned from Titanic training data](index_files/figure-ipynb/visualise-tree-output-1.png){#visualise-tree}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe tree shows the splitting logic clearly. Each box contains the splitting rule, the Gini impurity, the number of samples, and the predicted class. Following any path from root to leaf gives you the sequence of decisions that lead to a prediction. For example, if a passenger is female (sex ≤ 0.5 is false), the tree predicts survival regardless of other features.\n\nThis interpretability is the key strength of decision trees. You can explain exactly why a model made a specific prediction by showing the decision path. However, trees have a significant weakness: they tend to overfit the training data by learning overly specific rules that don't generalise well.\n\n[^Gini]: Gini impurity measures how mixed the classes are in a node. A pure node (all survivors or all deaths) has Gini = 0. A 50/50 split has Gini = 0.5. The algorithm chooses splits that minimise Gini impurity.\n\n### Random Forests\n\nRandom forests address the overfitting problem by training many trees and combining their predictions. Each tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the training data (bootstrap sample), and at each split, only a random subset of features is considered. This randomness ensures each tree learns slightly different patterns.\n\nWhen making predictions, each tree votes for a class, and the forest returns the majority vote. Because individual trees make different mistakes, averaging across trees produces more reliable predictions that generalise better to new data.\n\n::: {#random-forest .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# train random forest\nrf_model = RandomForestClassifier(\n    n_estimators=100,  # number of trees\n    max_depth=3,       # keep trees shallow to match single tree\n    random_state=42\n)\nrf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# evaluate on test set\nrf_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)\nrf_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, rf_pred)\n\nprint(f\"Random Forest Accuracy: {rf_accuracy:.1%}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRandom Forest Accuracy: 78.7%\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRandom forests typically outperform single decision trees because the ensemble smooths out individual tree errors. The trade-off is reduced interpretability: you can't easily visualise 100 trees or explain a prediction as a single decision path.\n\n### Gradient Boosting\n\nGradient boosting takes a different approach to combining trees. Instead of training trees independently and averaging, it trains them sequentially. Each new tree focuses on the mistakes made by previous trees, gradually improving the model's performance.\n\nThe process works as follows: train the first tree on the original data, identify where it makes prediction errors, train the second tree to correct those errors, and repeat. Each tree contributes to the final prediction, with later trees typically having more influence because they've learned from more mistakes.\n\n::: {#gradient-boosting .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# train gradient boosting model\ngb_model = GradientBoostingClassifier(\n    n_estimators=100,\n    max_depth=3,\n    learning_rate=0.1,  # how much each tree contributes\n    random_state=42\n)\ngb_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n# evaluate on test set\ngb_pred = gb_model.predict(X_test)\ngb_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, gb_pred)\n\nprint(f\"Gradient Boosting Accuracy: {gb_accuracy:.1%}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nGradient Boosting Accuracy: 81.7%\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nGradient boosting often achieves the best performance of these algorithms, particularly on tabular data. It's the foundation of winning Kaggle solutions and production models at major tech companies. The sequential learning process allows it to capture complex patterns that other models miss. Like random forests, the trade-off is reduced interpretability compared to single trees.\n\n## Comparing Model Performance\n\nDifferent models learned different patterns from the same training data. Comparing their test set performance shows which patterns generalised best to unseen data.\n\n::: {#model-comparison .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# create comparison dataframe\ncomparison = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Model': ['Logistic Regression', 'Decision Tree', 'Random Forest', 'Gradient Boosting'],\n    'Accuracy': [lr_accuracy, tree_accuracy, rf_accuracy, gb_accuracy]\n})\n\n# sort by accuracy\ncomparison = comparison.sort_values('Accuracy', ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)\n\nprint(comparison.to_string(index=False))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n              Model  Accuracy\n  Gradient Boosting  0.817164\n      Decision Tree  0.805970\nLogistic Regression  0.794776\n      Random Forest  0.787313\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe results demonstrate several principles. First, no single model dominates across all problems. Second, more complex models (random forest, gradient boosting) often outperform simpler ones, but not always. Third, even small accuracy differences can be meaningful depending on the application[^ClinicalSignificance].\n\nWe can also examine what each model learned by looking at feature importance. Tree-based models calculate feature importance based on how much each feature reduces impurity when used for splitting.\n\n::: {#cell-feature-importance .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# create dataframe for plotting\nfeature_names = X_train.columns\nimportance_data = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Feature': list(feature_names) * 3,\n    'Importance': list(tree_model.feature_importances_) + \n                  list(rf_model.feature_importances_) + \n                  list(gb_model.feature_importances_),\n    'Model': ['Decision Tree'] * len(feature_names) + \n             ['Random Forest'] * len(feature_names) + \n             ['Gradient Boosting'] * len(feature_names)\n})\n\n# create faceted plot\ng = sns.FacetGrid(importance_data, col='Model', height=4, aspect=0.8)\ng.map_dataframe(sns.barplot, y='Feature', x='Importance', order=feature_names)\ng.set_axis_labels('Importance', '')\ng.set_titles(col_template='{col_name}')\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Feature importance comparison across tree-based models](index_files/figure-ipynb/feature-importance-output-1.png){#feature-importance}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe feature importance plots reveal what each model learned. All three tree-based models identified sex as the most important feature, which aligns with historical accounts of \"women and children first\" evacuation procedures. However, the models weight other features differently, showing they learned distinct patterns from the same data.\n\n[^ClinicalSignificance]: In healthcare applications, statistical significance doesn't always equal clinical significance. A 2% improvement in accuracy might be meaningless for one use case and critically important for another. Domain knowledge determines whether model differences matter.\n\n## Overfitting and Model Complexity\n\nModel complexity is controlled through hyperparameters. For decision trees, the most important hyperparameter is `max_depth`, which limits how many sequential questions the tree can ask. Shallow trees underfit by not learning enough patterns. Deep trees overfit by learning noise in the training data.\n\n::: {#cell-overfitting-demo .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# test different tree depths\ndepths = range(1, 16)\ntrain_scores = []\ntest_scores = []\n\nfor depth in depths:\n    tree = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=depth, random_state=42)\n    tree.fit(X_train, y_train)\n    \n    train_scores.append(accuracy_score(y_train, tree.predict(X_train)))\n    test_scores.append(accuracy_score(y_test, tree.predict(X_test)))\n\n# create dataframe for plotting\noverfitting_data = pd.DataFrame({\n    'Tree Depth': list(depths) * 2,\n    'Accuracy': train_scores + test_scores,\n    'Dataset': ['Training Accuracy'] * len(depths) + ['Test Accuracy'] * len(depths)\n})\n\n# plot results\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.lineplot(data=overfitting_data, x='Tree Depth', y='Accuracy', hue='Dataset', \n             marker='o', markersize=6)\nplt.title('Overfitting in Decision Trees')\nplt.grid(True, alpha=0.3)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![Training and test accuracy vs tree depth, showing the overfitting threshold](index_files/figure-ipynb/overfitting-demo-output-1.png){#overfitting-demo}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe plot demonstrates the classic overfitting pattern. As tree depth increases, training accuracy continues to improve because the tree learns increasingly specific rules about the training data. However, test accuracy peaks at moderate depth then declines. Beyond that peak, the tree is learning patterns that don't generalise to new data.\n\nFinding the optimal complexity requires validation on held-out data. This principle applies to all models: logistic regression regularisation strength, random forest tree count and depth, gradient boosting learning rate and iterations. The goal is maximising generalisation, not training performance.\n\n## Summary\n\nUnderstanding how models learn transforms machine learning from a black box into a practical tool. Different algorithms approach learning differently: logistic regression finds linear boundaries, decision trees ask sequential questions, random forests combine many trees through voting, and gradient boosting trains trees that learn from previous mistakes.\n\nNo algorithm works best in all situations. Simpler models like logistic regression and shallow decision trees are more interpretable but may miss complex patterns. Ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting often achieve better performance but sacrifice interpretability. The right choice depends on your data, your constraints, and whether you need to explain predictions to stakeholders.\n\nThe key principles from this session apply broadly. Test multiple models and compare performance. Use validation data to detect overfitting. Examine feature importance to understand what models learned. Control complexity through hyperparameters. These practices form the foundation of effective model development.\n\nWhat we haven't covered yet is how to systematically tune hyperparameters, how to handle imbalanced classes, or how to evaluate models using metrics beyond accuracy. We also haven't explored feature engineering, which often matters more than algorithm choice. These topics build on the foundations we've established and will be covered in future sessions.\n\n---\njupyter:\n  kernelspec:\n    display_name: Python 3 (ipykernel)\n    language: python\n    name: python3\n    path: C:\\Users\\paul.johnson\\git\\code-club\\.venv\\share\\jupyter\\kernels\\python3\n---\n",
