Ever had a request where you need historic data from NHS publications where each .csv file is on its own web page and you are faced with negotiating dozens of clicks and dialogue boxes? Ever wanted to pipe public data directly into a report to provide wider context entirely fuss-free? Then you have come to the right tutorial. We are going to cover two methods for doing these very things, things that you can take away and apply today: no highfalutin concepts to digest, no need to hold out hope for a juicy data science project to get your teeth into. What's more, we are going to give you some examples of public datasets that you can try these out on, giving you data with which to exercise your other Python skills.\n\nThe first method we are going to cover is webscraping, which is basically a way to retrieve elements on web pages by accessing them via the HTML tags (stay with us, there's no need to become an expert in HTML, the Python package is going to do the hard work).\n\nThe second method is to access data made available via APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). We will specifically be looking at APIs that provide the data in JSON format, something which only requires minimal manipulation to put it into a dataframe.\n\nHowever, before we get to the good stuff, there are a few things to touch on that will prove essential when using these two methods. They relate to accessing URLs (web links) dynamically and making requests to content via the web. We will give you a brief introduction to prime you for when they come up later.\n\n## Regular Expressions\n\nThis is a very important part of webscraping and making API calls since you are often interested in accessing web pages, hosted files and API endpoints based on a URL pattern. Where it becomes useful is when you want to programmatically access any URLs or file names that match a pattern, but contain an element that can vary: for example, when there are monthly editions of a publication, where the file name or URL contains the name of the month. Take the example below:\n\n::: {#regex-example .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndynamic_section = r'^england-[a-z]+-202[0-9]$'\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis regular expression is intended to represent the changing part of a URL that points to the specific pages where monthly publications are hosted. Let's look at the elements:\n\n- The \"r\" in front of the string tells Python that it should handle whatever comes between the quotation marks as a **raw** string, which is to say that it should ignore any of Python's conventions around special characters, such as backslash being an escape character, and that it should pass the regex string to the `re` functions without manipulating it in any way.\n- The \"^\" states that the following characters must come at the beginning of the string that you are searching, i.e. nothing should come before it.\n- The \"$\" denotes the end of the string, i.e. nothing should come after it.\n- The string must start with the sequence \"england-\".\n- It must end with the sequence \"-202x\", where x is any digit from 0 to 9.\n- And the \"[a-z]+\" means that the string will contain one or more (the \"+\") lower case alphabetical characters (\"[a-z]\", i.e. any lower case letter in the range between the square brackets).\n\nTaking the following as the base URL...\n\n`'https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/learning-disabilities-health-check-scheme'`\n\nThe following would be valid URLs matching the pattern of `dynamic_section`:\n\n`https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/learning-disabilities-health-check-scheme/england-january-2024`\n\n`https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/learning-disabilities-health-check-scheme/england-may-2021`\n\nBut the following would be ignored:\n\n`https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/learning-disabilities-health-check-scheme/england-quarter-4-2020-21`\n\n\nIf you want a hand with creating a regular expression that does the job for your situation, [https://pythex.org](https://pythex.org) has an interface that can be used to test regex patterns against text springs, as well as a regex cheatsheet. The [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-regex/) tutorial has a good set of examples of what each regex character sequence could be used to target.\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Choose the right library\nThe Python library to use when constructing regular expressions is `re`. There is also a library called `regex`, but it is an older library with less functionality. You do not need to explicitly _install_ `re` since it comes with Python when that is installed, but you still need to _import_ it.\n:::\n\n\n## The REST standard and GET requests\n\nWhen it comes to making requests for data online, it is important to understand a little about how they are made and the standard that underpins them. The requests that we are concerned with follow the **REST** (**RE**presentational **S**tate **T**ransfer) standard. REST guides the design of processes, standardising and simplifying the communication of requests for data hosted on web servers. As a result, operations are made using a standard set of terms. The most common ones are listed below:\n\n- **GET**: is used when you want to **read** data on the server.\n- **POST**: is used to **create** data.\n-  **PATCH** (or PUT): is used to **update** data.\n- **DELETE**: no surprise, is used to **delete** data.\n\nSince this tutorial is teaching you to be a consumer of this data, we are really only interested in GET requests. Whether you are webscraping or making a request to an API endpoint, you will be making a GET request. The first step of each is to make a GET request using the `request` library and checking which response is returned:\n\n- A response of **200** is positive, i.e. there is data to be had via the supplied URL.\n- **400** is a negative response.\n- **304** is a \"not modified\" or \"no new data\" reponse, which will come up again later when we cover API call etiquette.\n- These codes are often built into try/except or if/else blocks to govern what happens when there is / isn't any available data.\n- There are [many other codes](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/) that you may wish to handle, particularly if you want to generate informative error messages, but the three listed above should be enough to get you started.\n\n::: {#get-response-example .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport request as req\n\nurl = [...] # the target URL\n\nresponse = req.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n  # do something with the data\nelse:\n  print(f'Failed to fetch webpage: {response.status_code}')\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow that we have introduced those concepts, we can start having a look at the things you were promised.\n\n## Webscraping\n\nThis is a really handy tool for automating the extraction from a web page of anything that is encoded with HTML tags. It can be used to: \n\n- Download files hosted on the web server and made available via hyperlinks; for example, monthly / annual data publications.\n- Copy down data tables appearing on a web page and converting them to a Pandas dataframe; for example, data collection deadlines / data dissemination dates.\n- Copy text from the page title, headers or the body of the page.\n- Copy images, hyperlinks, mailto links, iframes... \n\n### HTML tags\n\nThese are important since they encode the structure of a web page. Understanding these gives you an idea of what is possible when it comes to accessing elements of the structure of a web page.\n\nThere's a nice compact HTML cheatsheet from [Stanford University](https://web.stanford.edu/group/csp/cs21/htmlcheatsheet.pdf), but if you are not into the whole brevity thing, [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/html/html-cheat-sheet/) has got you covered again with a nicely laid-out explanation of each.\n\n### Beautiful Soup\n\nOne of the most commonly used libraries for webscraping is Beautiful Soup. It parses the HTML and allows the user to access the elements using familiar Python syntax. The [documentation](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is very comprehensive, and the Quick Start section provides plenty of useful, simple examples.\n\nTo install it in your Python environment, enter `uv add beautifulsoup4` into your terminal.\n\nNote that when you import it into your script, you write: `from bs4 import BeautifulSoup`. \n\n### Examples\n\nLet's see how this is used in practise. First of all, we will install the packages that we are going to be using.\n\n::: {#import-packages .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup # the webscraping library\n\nimport requests as req # the web request library\n\nimport re # the regular expressions library that comes with the Python installation.\n\n# this will help us construct dynamic URLs from different elements joined together.\n# it can also be used to make HTTP requests.\n# it is installed by entering \"uv add urllib3\" into your terminal\nfrom urllib.parse import urljoin \n\n# used for converting files into binary data, which can then be converted into \n# other formats.\n# it comes as part of the Python installation.\nfrom io import StringIO \n\nimport pandas as pd # so that we can store our data in a dataframe\n\nimport os # operating system functions, such as accessing file directories\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### A simple request to retrieve a web page title\n\n:::{.callout-note}\n## Instantiation\nNote that it is conventional to instantiate a BeautifulSoup parser object as \"soup\".\n:::\n\n::: {#page-title .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl = 'https://www.scwcsu.nhs.uk/about/our-values' # define the url in question\n\nresponse = req.get(url) # define the response as a GET request to the URL\n\n# if there is a positive reponse to the request, create a BeautifulSoup parser object\n# that collects the parsed content of the response.\n# Then print the web page \"title\" element.\n# The parser library being used is Python's in-built \"html.parser\"\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n    print('Webpage title:', soup.title.string)\n\n# otherwise, return a helpful error message\nelse:\n    print(f'Failed to fetch webpage: {response.status_code}')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nWebpage title: Our values - NHS SCW Support and Transformation for Health and Care\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor a list of alternative parser libraries, see [this](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-a-parser) section of the BeautifulSoup documentation.\n\n#### Display the full HTML of a web page.\n\nIf you want to inspect all of the HTML code for a given page, so that you can get an idea of what is available, you can use the `prettify()` method. This re-uses the same `soup` object defined above. The output of the code will not be produced since it has been deactivated so that it does not take up too much space on our website. We recommend that you run it in a downloaded copy of the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.\n\n::: {#full-html .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(soup.prettify())\n```\n:::\n\n\n#### Scrape information from a table on a web page.\n\n::: {#cell-scrape-table .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl = ('https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-sets/mental-health-services-data-set/submit-data')\n\nresponse = req.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, \"html.parser\")\n\ntables = soup.find_all('table') # if you are sure there is only one, use \"soup.find()\"\nprint(type(tables))\n\n# get the first item in the BeautifulSoup ResultSet, convert it into a string, \n# and read the html into a pandas DataFrame\ntable_df = pd.read_html(str(tables))[0]     # if you are sure there is just one, no need to select by index \"[0]\"\n\ntable_df\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<class 'bs4.element.ResultSet'>\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#scrape-table .cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Performance month</th>\n      <th>Updates/Resubmissions</th>\n      <th>Cut of data taken at 11:59:59pm</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>October 2025</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July, August September</td>\n      <td>25 November 2025</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>November 2025</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July, August, September, Oct...</td>\n      <td>22 December 2025</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>December 2025</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July, August, September, Oct...</td>\n      <td>26 January 2025</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>January 2026</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July, August, September, Oct...</td>\n      <td>24 February 2026</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>February 2026</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July, August, September, Oct...</td>\n      <td>24 March 2026</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>5</th>\n      <td>March 2026</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July, August, September, Oct...</td>\n      <td>27 April 2026</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>6</th>\n      <td>April 2026</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July, August, September, Oct...</td>\n      <td>27 May 2026 (end of year for resubmissions)</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>7</th>\n      <td>May 2026</td>\n      <td>April</td>\n      <td>24 June 2026</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>8</th>\n      <td>June 2026</td>\n      <td>April, May</td>\n      <td>23 July 2026</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>9</th>\n      <td>July 2026</td>\n      <td>April, May, June</td>\n      <td>25 August 2026</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>10</th>\n      <td>August 2026</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July</td>\n      <td>23 September 2026</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>11</th>\n      <td>September 2026</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July, August</td>\n      <td>26 October 2026</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>12</th>\n      <td>October 2026</td>\n      <td>April, May, June, July, August, September</td>\n      <td>24 November 2026</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n#### Locate a .csv file on a webpage.\n\nMost of the code is the same as the \"title\" example, but this time we are looking for a hyperlink on the page that points to a .csv file (that is to say, the URL ends with the .csv file extension).\n\n::: {#locate-csv .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nurl = ('https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/out-of-area-placements-in-mental-health-services/march-2024') \n\nresponse = req.get(url)\n\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')\n\n    #

API stands for **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface, and these are used to extend the functionality of an application allowing it to communicate with another. \n\nWe will specifically be looking at web APIs that return their data in JSON format[^Alternative]. For a very simple explanation of what JSON data is, have a look at the [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_json.asp) page. In short, it is a format that is typically used for sending data from a server to a web page. The key thing to understand about them is that each record takes the form of a list of key : value pairs, looking just like a Python dictionary, and multiple records are contained in an array denoted by square brackets. You will see this structure reflected in the Python code below.\n\n[^Alternative]: XML is another common format for data made available via an API endpoint.\n\nFor this demonstration, we are going to pull in flood alerts with at least a severity score of 3 from the Environment Agency's live flood alert data[^Flood_Documentation]. If you want to see the data that we will be extracting in its original JSON format, follow this [URL](https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/id/floods?min-severity=3). It is the same URL as will be used in the the Python-based request.\n\n[^Flood_Documentation]: [Environment Agency real-time flood-monitoring API documentation](https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/doc/reference)\n\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n## \nThe options available for querying the data is determined by the way in which the API endpoint has been constructed by the developers. For example, the data may be aggregated by default, meaning that an unfiltered request returns the data aggregated to the highest level. This may well be intended to stop people from requesting masses of granular data by default, but it can be difficult to get an idea of what the available categories are in the data breakdown, if there isn't a dedicated part of the API that allows for the breakdown categories to be returned in a list. It is important to read the API documentation thoroughly to get an undestanding of what your options are.\n:::\n\nNow for the code itself. As was mentioned in the section above on REST and GET requests, we need to import the `requests` library to make the GET request. We also need to import the `json` library, which decodes the JSON format, converting the JSON data types into Python data types. A table of these conversions can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#encoders-and-decoders).\n\nThe example below has been placed inside a function. This isn't essential, but it can prove useful if you want to expand the function to take inputs that make it reusable and apply it to different extracts of the data. You will also see that placing the code inside a function becomes necessary when using Python **generators**, which is another topic [covered later on](sessions/intermediate-skills/xx-generators/index.html) in our Intermediate Skills curriculum.\n\n::: {#flood-data-function .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport json\n\nimport requests as req\n\ndef get_flood_alerts():\n    request_url = 'https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/id/floods?min-severity=3' # Step 1\n    response = req.get(request_url) # Step 2\n    if response.status_code == 200: # Step 3\n        results_json = response.json()['items'] # Step 4\n        alerts = [{   # Step 5\n            'id' : json['@id'], # Step 6\n            'description' : json['description'],\n            'area_name' : json['eaAreaName'],\n            'flood_area_id' : json['floodAreaID'],\n            'is_tidal' : json['isTidal'],\n            'severity' : json['severity'],\n            'severity_level' : json['severityLevel'],\n            'time_message_changed' : json['timeMessageChanged'],\n            'time_raised' : json['timeRaised'],\n            'time_severity_changed' : json['timeSeverityChanged']\n        } for json in results_json] # Step 5 continued\n        return alerts # Step 7\n    else:\n        print(f'Failed to fetch data. Response status: {response.status_code}') # Step 3 continued\n```\n:::\n\n\n**The steps below are labelled in the code above:**\n\n1. The first step is to define the request URL, which points to the API endpoint. If you follow the link in a web browser, you will see all of the relevant records laid out in JSON format. Note that in the example below there is the section `\"min-severity=3\"` which comes after a question mark `?`. The question mark indicates that everything after it relates to an **optional filter**, which is to say that you can get a cut of the data based on specific criteria. You can add multiple filters by joining them together with \"&\".\n2. Then a GET request is made and assigned to the variable \"response\".\n3. Then, as with the webscraping, we want to handle the response from the webserver gracefully, in case the data is not available. This means placing details of what we are requesting in an if/else conditional statement. If we get a positive response of 200, proceed with retrieving the data; otherwise, return the error code.\n4. The results of the JSON data request are returned as a dictionary (remember that data in JSON format is very similar to Python dictionaries). In the flood data API, `'items'` is the key in the dictionary, and the values are all of the data records[^Hierarchy]. In the line `results_json = response.json()['items']`, we are accessing all of the records stored against \"items\".\n5. The values corresponding to the key \"items\" are held in an array (in square brackets). We give the results that we want to return the variable name `alerts`. We then create a `for` loop to create a Python list of all of the records, and for each record there is a key : value pair for each field in the data, replicating the array / JSON record object structure. Think of each key in the dictionary as being a column name, each value as the record value and each item in the `alerts` list as being a row.\n6. In the dictionary, we give the key a name of our choosing. It is what _we_ want the column name to be. On the value side of the dictionary, we are accessing the value corresponding to each key in the JSON reponse. In the line `for json in results_json`, each `json` is it's own dictionary containing a record, for example `\"@id\" : \"http://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/id/floods/112WAFTUBA\",` \\newline `\"description\" : \"Upper Bristol Avon area\", \"eaAreaName\" : \"Wessex\"...`. We want to access the value corresponding to each key in the JSON data and store it against _our_ key.\n7. The list of records is returned in a format that can be used by other Python packages.\n\n[^Hierarchy]: In actual fact, the format that the flood alert data is provided in is a little more complex and is more like a nested dictionary, where you have a top-level set of key-value pairs and one of those keys has values that are themselves dictionaries. In the case of the flood alert data, there are some metadata fields that are defined in the top level alongside \"items\", and then the value against the \"items\" key is then itself an array of key-value pairs. \n\nLet's put the results of the query into a Pandas DataFrame and view the results. For this we call the function we defined above and have Pandas convert that list into a DataFrame, with column names that we have given it and rows that correspond to each record.\n\n::: {#cell-flood-data-results .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nalerts = pd.DataFrame(get_flood_alerts())\n\nprint(f'Number of rows and columns in the dataset: {alerts.shape}')\n\nalerts.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nNumber of rows and columns in the dataset: (140, 10)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {#flood-data-results .cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=8}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>id</th>\n      <th>description</th>\n      <th>area_name</th>\n      <th>flood_area_id</th>\n      <th>is_tidal</th>\n      <th>severity</th>\n      <th>severity_level</th>\n      <th>time_message_changed</th>\n      <th>time_raised</th>\n      <th>time_severity_changed</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>http://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitorin...</td>\n      <td>River Arrow and River Alne</td>\n      <td>West Midlands</td>\n      <td>033WAF205</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>Flood alert</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T16:36:00</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T16:36:35</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T16:36:00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>http://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitorin...</td>\n      <td>Upper Bristol Avon area</td>\n      <td>Wessex</td>\n      <td>112WAFTUBA</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>Flood alert</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T09:51:00</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T09:51:36</td>\n      <td>2026-01-15T18:20:00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>http://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitorin...</td>\n      <td>Lower River Soar in Leicestershire</td>\n      <td>East Midlands</td>\n      <td>034WAF428</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>Flood alert</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T14:19:00</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T14:19:26</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T14:19:00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>http://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitorin...</td>\n      <td>River Churn and its tributaries</td>\n      <td>Thames</td>\n      <td>061WAF02Churn</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>Flood alert</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T08:44:00</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T08:44:00</td>\n      <td>2026-01-15T21:04:00</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>http://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitorin...</td>\n      <td>River Cherwell from Lower Heyford down to and ...</td>\n      <td>Thames</td>\n      <td>061WAF14LChrwell</td>\n      <td>False</td>\n      <td>Flood alert</td>\n      <td>3</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T09:53:00</td>\n      <td>2026-02-26T09:53:40</td>\n      <td>2026-01-11T08:41:00</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## API request etiquette\n\nThese are particularly important if you are making requests to free, public APIs, such as those provided by the government and NHS. These considerations are a little more advanced, and are probably only required if you are intending to develop something that supplies data with frequent updates, but it is worth being aware of them: You may start with a project that is small and simple, but it might then develop into something more data-hungry\n\n#### Respect rate limits\n\nAPIs typically define:\n\n- Requests per second/minute\n- Daily/monthly quotas\n- Burst versus sustained limits\n\nThey may not be stated explicitly, but you should assume that these limits exist and throttle your calls appropriately. For more information on throttling techniques, have a look at this [Medium post](https://medium.com/@datajournal/how-to-throttle-requests-c1f9dcd8508f).\n\n#### Use caching\n\nIf the API isn't subject to frequent changes, cache results locally so that you do not need to make repeated requests for the same data. Here's a [Geeks for Geeks tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/how-to-implement-file-caching-in-python/) on different types of caching in Python to get you started. \n\nIf you intend to create your own web app that is pulling in data from other sources, it is likely that you will be using a particular web app framework, and these will provide their own tools for web caching. For example, we have introduced [Steamlit](sessions/essential-skills/10-streamlit/index.html) in another tutorial and their overview of caching can be found [here](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/concepts/architecture/caching). Another framework for creating web apps is [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) and a simple introduction to web caching using that framework can be found on [PyQuestHub](https://pyquesthub.com/implementing-web-caching-in-python-for-enhanced-performance).\n\n#### Avoid polling too aggressively\n\n- Make requests at a reasonable rate: do you really need to check for updates every second?. You can find out more about polling in this [Medium blog post](https://medium.com/@sankalpa115/what-is-polling-b1ff70e87001).\n- Make use of webhooks: these allow for automatic communication between systems, eliminating the need for one system to constantly check another for updates. Data is pushed automatically whenever an event occurs. You can find another trusty Geek's for Geek's tutorial on webhooks [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/blogs/what-is-a-webhook-and-how-to-use-it/).\n\n#### Use conditional requests\n\nIf supported, you can use `ETag` and `If-Modified-Since`, which return a `304 Not Modfied` reponse instead of a full JSON payload. In essence, this response is saying that no changes have been made to the content made available via the endpoint. You could build in some logic that handles the error without crashing the program, and also notifies the end user that there is no new data since the last update.\n\nExamples of each, plus a combined approach, can be found in this [Python Lore tutorial](https://www.pythonlore.com/handling-http-conditional-requests-with-requests/).\n\n#### Select only what you need\n\nJust as you would with a SQL query, try to select only what you need. Some APIs support field selection in the optional filters part of the URL (e.g `?fields=metric,value`). Similarly, try not to request all of the records made available via the API. Would having a rolling 12 months' data be sufficient? Could you store historic data locally? Try to use any filters available in the API to exclude any data that you do not need.\n\n#### Identify yourself\n\nSome APIs require users to provide a `User-Agent` string. Failure to do so could mean that your request gets blocked by the web server. Web servers use the information to serve appropriate content, implement rate-limiting or block automated requests[^UserAgentSource]. You can even add some kind of contact information or a link to the repository for your application so that you can be contacted if there is an issue (only include contact information you are willing to share publicly!). Below is an example of some Python that could be used to generate a `User-Agent` string:\n\n[^UserAgentSource]: See (https://webscraping.ai/faq/requests/how-do-i-set-a-user-agent-string-for-requests)\n\n::: {#user-agent-builder .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport platform     # to get operating system information\nimport sys          # to get Python version information\n\nAPP_NAME = \"MyApiProject\"\nAPP_VERSION = \"1.0\"\nGITHUB_PAGE = \"https://github.com/NHS-South-Central-and-West/code-club\"\n\ndef build_user_agent():\n    python_version = f\"{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}\"\n    os_info = platform.system()\n    return f\"{APP_NAME}/{APP_VERSION} (Python {python_version}; {os_info}); {GITHUB_PAGE}\"\n\nheaders = {\n    \"User-Agent\": build_user_agent()\n}\n\n# let's see what that looks like:\n\nprint(headers)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n{'User-Agent': 'MyApiProject/1.0 (Python 3.12; Windows); https://github.com/NHS-South-Central-and-West/code-club'}\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThen, when you make the request, you pass the `User-Agent` string to the \"headers\" keyword argument:\n\n::: {#user-agent-request .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nresponse = requests.get(\"https://environment.data.gov.uk/flood-monitoring/id/floods\", headers=headers)\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-caution}\n## Read the smallprint\nIt is advisable that you read any Terms of Service applied to the use of an API. Providers of free APIs may forbid commercial use (and you need to be sure what is meant by this), redistribution of the data and automated, high-frequency usage.\n\n:::\n\n## The `fingertips_py` package\n\nThis is a package that was originally developed by Public Health England to make it easy to import data via the Fingertips API endpoint. It's an example of what the possibilities are, hopefully serving as inspiration for your own Python projects. It's also pretty useful, if you want to make use of Fingertips data yourself!\n\nWe have created a walkthrough of using the `fingertips_py` package [here](sessions/intermediate-skills/18-webscraping-apis/fingertips_py.html).\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n1.
